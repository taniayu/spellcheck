spellcheck
==========
Author: Tania Yu

This project is a simple command line spell check and grading algorithm.
It uses as a dictionary the list of words found in the wordsEn.txt file
(obtained from http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/).

After running the program, the user is prompted to enter the file name
he/she wishes to grade (note that it currently only supports grading a
single paragraph with no newlines, as was asked by the prompt), and then
whether or not each misspelled word should be weighted equally (if not,
then words that are "more wrong" will lead to more points deducted).

A test paragraph test.txt is offered.

All code in this program was written by me.
